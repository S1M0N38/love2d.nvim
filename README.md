## üí° Idea

I wanted to experiment with [L√ñVE](https://love2d.org/). After reading this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1727alu/anyone_actively_using_love2d_with_neovim_and), I realized that it's not so easy to get started with L√ñVE and Neovim. Perhaps the trickiest part is getting LSP to work with L√ñVE. It's just one line in the LSP, but it's usually a very niche thing and I can't find many examples about it; moreover, the `${3rd}` libraries will be [deprecated](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/discussions/1950#discussion-4900461) in favor of Addons.

Being able to start and stop the game directly from Neovim (with keybindings) is also quite handy. So I decided to pack these functionalities (LSP L√ñVE config and game start/stop) into a dead simple plugin (so simple that it can barely be considered a plugin).

However, I believe that providing this simple codebase to explore can be a good introduction to the inner workings of Neovim plugins. People using L√ñVE know Lua, so the language barrier boils down to the Neovim specific API.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.9**
- [L√ñVE](https://www.love2d.org/)
- [lua_ls](https://luals.github.io/) configured with [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) (optional)

## üì¶ Installation

```lua
-- using lazy.nvim
{
  "S1M0N38/love2d.nvim",
  event = 'VeryLazy',
  cmd = "LoveRun",
  opts = { },
  keys = {
    { "<leader>v", ft = "lua", desc = "L√ñVE" },
    { "<leader>vv", "<cmd>LoveRun<cr>", ft = "lua", desc = "Run L√ñVE" },
    { "<leader>vs", "<cmd>LoveStop<cr>", ft = "lua", desc = "Stop L√ñVE" },
  },
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

Read the documentation with [`:help love2d`](https://github.com/S1M0N38/love2d.nvim/blob/main/doc/love2d.txt)

> Vim/Neovim plugins are usually shipped with :help documentation. Learning how to navigate it is a really valuable skill. If you are not familiar with it, start with `:help` and read the first 20 lines.
