SETUP                                                           *love2d-setup*

It's highly recommended to use a plugin manager to install love2d.nvim. For
example, using `lazy.nvim`:

>lua
  {
    "S1M0N38/love2d.nvim",
    event = "VeryLazy",
    opts = { },
    keys = {
      { "<leader>v", desc = "LÖVE" },
      { "<leader>vv", "<cmd>LoveRun<cr>", desc = "Run LÖVE" },
      { "<leader>vs", "<cmd>LoveStop<cr>", desc = "Stop LÖVE" },
    },
  }
<

Usually, in the installation example, the plugin author provides the bare
minimum setup. However, love2d.nvim has very few options so it makes sense to
discuss them here. Here is the breakdown of the previous example:

- `S1M0N38/love2d.nvim`: Where to download the plugin hosted on GitHub.
- `cmd`: Load this plugin only when the `:LoveRun` command is called.
- `opts`: A table with plugin options. See |love2d.setup()|.
- `keys`: Key mappings for the plugin.

So with this configuration, when the command `:LoveRun` is called:

1. The `love2d.nvim` plugin is loaded
2. |love2d.setup()| is called with the `opts` table
3. The command `:LoveRun` is run. See |love2d-commands|.

(If you are too lazy to run the `:LoveRun` command, you can use the keymap
`<leader>vv`)


                                                              *love2d.setup()*
love2d.setup({opts}) ~

  The `<plugin>.setup()` function is a convention used by many plugins to set
  up options provided by the user. It's so common that `lazy.nvim`
  automatically calls the `<plugin>.setup()` function using the `opts` table.

  The table `opts` that you specify, will be merged with the default options
  which are:

>lua
  {
    path_to_love_bin = "love",
    restart_on_save = false,
    debug_window_opts = nil,
    setup_makeprg = true,
    identify_love_projects = true
  }
<

  - `path_to_love_bin`: The path to the `love` binary. If you have the `love`
    binary in your `PATH` you can leave this option empty. If you are using
    MacOS, you can add `love.app` to your `/Applications` and then set to
    `"/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love"`

  - `restart_on_save`: Restart the game using |love2d.stop()| and
    |love2d.run()| when you save a file in the game project.

  - `debug_window_opts`: If set, a new window will be opened showing the
    stdout of the running LÖVE project. This is useful for debugging using
    `print()` statements. The value should be a table compatible with the
    `opts` parameter of |nvim_open_win()|. For example, to open a split window
    below the current one:

>lua
  {
    debug_window_opts = {
      split = "below",
    }
  }
<

  - `setup_makeprg`: When true (default), automatically setup `makeprg` and
    `errorformat` for LÖVE projects. This allows you to use `:make` to run
    your LÖVE project and parse error messages to jump to the correct file
    and line number when errors occur.

  - `identify_love_projects`: When true (default), the plugin will only
    initialize LSP support if it detects a LÖVE project. Detection works by
    checking for a `main.lua` file in the current directory or by scanning
    `*.lua` files for usage of `love.*` functions. When false, LSP support
    will always be initialized regardless of project type.

  The plugin automatically provides LÖVE and LuaSocket library definitions
  for LSP support - no manual library path configuration is required.

COMMANDS                                                     *love2d-commands*

User commands, that is commands that start with `:` followed by a capital
letter, are the main way to interact with plugins. The available commands
provided by this plugin are:

:LoveRun [path/to/game/src] ~
  When running this command without providing `path/to/game/src`, love2d will
  try to look for the directory containing `main.lua`. If you try to run
  from a source file of your game, it should work.
  You can also provide the path to your game source code to run the game. For
  example, if you focus on developing only one game at a time, it makes sense
  to define a keymap to run that specific game.

:LoveStop  ~
  If you have previously started a game using `:LoveRun`, you can stop it
  using this command.


================================================================================
LSP                                                               *love2d-lsp*

Language Server Protocol (LSP) is the way to provide code completion, linting,
formatting, and other language-specific features to your editor. So it
effectively makes your editor smarter, enhancing your development experience.

This plugin automatically configures `lua_ls` for LÖVE development when a LÖVE
project is detected. It uses Neovim's built-in LSP configuration system
(`vim.lsp.config`) available in Neovim 0.11+. The plugin will:

- Configure Lua 5.1/LuaJIT runtime settings appropriate for LÖVE
- Add bundled LÖVE and LuaSocket library definitions to the workspace
- Merge with any existing `lua_ls` configuration you may have
- Only activate when `identify_love_projects` detects a LÖVE project

For example, when placing the cursor over the `love` variable and pressing
`K`, you should see the documentation for the `love` namespace.


================================================================================
GLSL                                                             *love2d-glsl*

OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) is a high-level shading language for writing
shaders. Shaders are small programs which are run on the graphics card when
drawing. See https://www.love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.newShader section
"Shader Language" for love2d specific aliases.

This plugin adds additional queries for Treesitter to support inline GLSL in
specific places. For example, when calling `love.graphics.newShader()`.

For these queries to take effect, you need to have `lua` and `glsl` parsers
installed. The easiest way to do so is by using the plugin `nvim-treesitter`
from GitHub https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter. After
installing the plugin, you can run `:TSInstall lua glsl` to install parsers.

Doing so will enable Neovim to "understand" that the string inside
`love.graphics.newShader()` is not just a string, but `glsl` code. And you
will get:

1. Syntax highlighting for inline shaders.
2. If you have `Comment.nvim`, it will now properly comment inside shaders.
3. The plugin `nvim-treesitter-textobjects` will now work inside shaders.
4. And any other plugin/feature that depends on Treesitter.

If parsers are installed and the plugin is loaded, you should see the code
below properly highlighted! (You may have to execute |:edit| to refresh the
current file)

>lua
  love.graphics.newShader([[
    vec4 effect(vec4 color, Image tex, vec2 texture_coords, vec2 screen_coords)
    {
        vec4 texturecolor = VideoTexel(texture_coords);
        return texturecolor * color;
    }
  ]])
